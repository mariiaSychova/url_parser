### URL Parser

URL Parser developed to parse URLs into structured components such as scheme, domain, path, query and fragment.

### Parsing Process

URL Parser processes a URL string and extracts the following components:

1. **Scheme**: The protocol used (for example, "http", "https").
2. **Domain**: The domain name or IP address of the URL (for example, "example.com").
3. **Path**: The path that specifies the resource location on the server (for example, "/products/electronics").
4. **Query**: The query string following a '?', used for passing parameters (for example, "?query=1").
5. **Fragment**: The section identifier following a '#', referring to a part of the resource (for example, "#reviews").

The parsed components are essential for applications needing to analyze, validate or manipulate URLs.
